3.1.0
------
- Fixed-size array fields (i.e. `[u8; N]`) now return `&[u8; N]` instead of `&[u8]` when accessed
- Fix no_std compatibility
- Add Data::into_slice()

3.0.0
------
Backward compatibility breaking changes:
- Simplify slice API in views: `layout.field_mut()` instead of `layout.field_mut().data_mut()`
- Removed SizedField::SIZE and added Field::SIZE as an Option<usize> (None if the field is open ended). This change breaks backwards compatibility for code using the SIZE field.
- Move some exported names into the "internal" namespace to denote that they're not supposed to be used in user code

Other changes:
- Added support for nested layouts
- Added the ::SIZE constant for returning the size of a whole layout.
- Added support for f32 and f64
- Added support for unit (`()`)
- Guard against users accidentally calling internal macros by marking them with '@'
- Fix some doc links
- Add inline annotations for better performance
